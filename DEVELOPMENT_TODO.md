## ❌ Pending Implementation

### 🔴 High Priority
1. **Pattern Discovery Enhancements**
   - Event-based pattern detection
   - Social sentiment analysis
   - On-chain pattern discovery

2. **Testing Infrastructure**
   - ⚠️ Basic backtesting implemented but needs expansion:
     - Needs full strategy validation pipeline
     - Needs multi-timeframe support
     - Needs proper integration with strategy lifecycle
   - Strategy validation pipeline
   - Unit tests for promotion/demotion

3. **Strategy Lifecycle**
   - Auto-promotion system (PAPER→MICRO→ACTIVE)
   - Configurable promotion thresholds
   - Performance-based demotion logic

4. **🧪 SimLab Parallel Simulation Engine** (In Progress)
   - ✅ Core SimLab engine implemented
   - ✅ Database schema for sim results
   - ✅ Integration with main trading system
   - ✅ Auto-discovery of data files
   - ❌ Feedback loop to strategy evolution
   - ❌ Synthetic scenario generation
   - ❌ Multi-timeframe replay support
   - ❌ Performance optimization for large datasets

### 🟡 Medium Priority
1. **Analysis Improvements**
   - Multi-timeframe analysis
   - Portfolio correlation management
   - Slippage and fee tracking accuracy

2. **Risk Management**
   - Position size limit optimization
   - Volume & spread filter refinement
   - Confidence threshold calibration

### 🟢 Low Priority
1. **Market Data**
   - News API integration
   - Social media sentiment tracking
   - On-chain data integration

2. **Trading Mechanics**
   - Limit order support
   - Stop-limit order implementation
   - Advanced order routing

3. **Documentation & Testing**
   - Strategy documentation automation
   - Performance reporting templates
   - System health monitoring

## 📈 Performance Goals
- Discovery Phase: 500+ strategies tested daily
- Optimization: Win rate > 65% after 100 trades
- Scaling: $200 → $1M in 90 days
- Risk Control: Max 20% drawdown limit

## 🔄 Next Steps
1. Focus on high-priority pattern discovery enhancements
2. Implement proper backtesting framework
3. Build strategy lifecycle automation
4. Improve risk management systems

## 💡 Notes
- System is operational in PAPER trading mode
- Core infrastructure is stable and tested
- Ready for aggressive strategy development
- Risk controls are in place and functioning
